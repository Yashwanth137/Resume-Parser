# Resume-Parser
#Bharat intern task -2 

There are two different approaches here.

One method is reading a resume and the other is taking a resume as input(Resume-parser-2).

The second method, predicts the job suitable based on the resume, whereas the first method extracts skills.

The following codes demonstrate a basic approach to extracting relevant skills from a resume and matching it with a list of required skills.
The AI reads the resume in doc format and analyzes it.

This was done by using nltk(Natural language tool kit) and python-docx in jupyter notebook.

nltk and python-docx are prerequisites of this code.
